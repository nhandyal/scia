Details:
Every user who uses the scia site must register an account (email and password).

When a new user registers with the site, they are issued a new 6 digit numeric scia_id. The id value is issed by the 
system through an auto increment field (id values cannot be manually set). The id is also printed on the issued member
card (if the user is a member). If a member loses their card, they can request a new member id with a corresponding member card.

So far so good?

Now within the full set of members, their are members, and board members. So how do we differentiate between the two? That's
where the is_board boolean flag is used. True if that particular member is on board, false otherwise. Now when a user transitions
from being a member to being on board or vise versa, we can simply toggle this flag true or false to give them elevated board
privileges or not. In this manner, we don't need to issue a new member id for members as they move onto board or off board. The
slight caveat to this statement is that if board cards are still used, a new board card (with the users existing member id) needs
to be issued.
