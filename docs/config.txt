there are a bunch of shits installed all over the place in our project

the local project with node dependencies is pretty straight forward,
clone the git repo
npm install
and you're good to go

(If you don't have node and mongo installed yet, there are a few other steps)
    (If you're running Mac OSX and haven't installed homebrew yet, shame on you)
    (If you're running windows, GG).

brew install node
brew install mongo


On the server side there is much more to do. I'm attempting to automate this, but till then
I need to keep a track of all the stuff I've done, and why

# makes deployment easy
# https://code.google.com/p/sshsudo/
# sshsudo (for the client) is included in our project under /lib
# nvm, apparently sshpass needs to be installed on the client so..
brew install https://raw.github.com/eugeneoden/homebrew/eca9de1/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb

sudo apt-get install  sshpass   --> for the server (not nescessary?)
