	requires : API UPDATE
	Seperate account registration from buying membership
		This opens the possibility to have non-member accounts
		| why ?
			- someone may be frequent events but not want to be a member
			- stored preferences (credit card details, notification settings)
			- alumni
			- simplifies renewal process*


	The registration flow now proceeds the same as previously outlined except we don't request payment details. After a user
	registers and logs into their account, they can go to account settings --> purchase membership, and then buy membership.

	* Since a user has to buy membership each year, instead of having a sepearte flow for new users and one for continuing users,
	we can now have every user (new/returning) by membership (renewal or not) through the same process flow.

	requires : API UPDATE
	Include a shopping cart for user convenience
		| why ?
			- allow a user to buy multiple tickets or services within a single transaction
			- convenience

	When a user says buy ticket (or service), the ticket is added to a shopping cart (client side). Once the user clicks checkout
	the transaction is posted to the server where we will issue the requested tickets. There will have to be stringent client side
	checks to only allow one member ticket to be bought per account per event.

	use : http://simplecartjs.org/ to implement the shopping cart.

	requires : nothing
	Allow vrf_tokens to persist till used (no automatic expiration)
		| why ?
			 - why not?

	What bennefit does it serve to automatically delete a vrf token after a certain time. In addition to annoying the shit out of
	a user, it adds unnescesary clutter and bloat to the code base. Since a vrf token is unique (in its randomness and email binding),
	there shouldn't be any reason to delete the vrf token. To remove bloat from the user table, we may consider deleting unverified
	user accounts after some time, but that's a different story.
